Problem statement â€“ A new online only bank is being kickoff.  
We need a web-based application server to handle normal banking transaction requests.  
Once registered in the website, 

you can open/close accounts, 
electronic check deposit via uploaded images and fund transfer one account to another account.  
If you want to withdraw cash, then customer will go to a real ATM machine and withdraw money using the same user/pin setup during registration.  
You will simulate with a separate ATM page/screen.  You are responsible to develop the website where customer can connect via web browser as a client.  
Mobile client is not required for this project.
